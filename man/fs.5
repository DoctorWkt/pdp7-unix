SYNOPSIS	--
.sp
DESCRIPTION	The RB09 fixed head disk has 8,000 64-word
	blocks on each of its two surfaces. Unix uses
	the second surface (physical blocks 8,000 to
	15,999) and numbers them from logical block 0 to
	logical block 7,999. The following discussion
	refers to logical blocks.
.sp
	The Unix filesystem is divided into 8,000 blocks
	of 64 words per block. Block 0 is the "sysdata"
	block. The first word points to the first block
	of the free-storage map. Each block in the
	free-storage map is structured as follows: the
	first word is the block number of the next block
	in the free-storage map, or zero if this is the
	end of the free-storage map. The next nine words
	hold free block numbers, or zero (no block
	number).
.sp
	Block 1 on the filesystem is unused. (?)
.sp
	I-numbers begin at 1, and the storage for
	i-nodes begins at block 2. Blocks 2 to 711
	contain the i-nodes, with five consecutive
	i-nodes per block. Certain i-nodes are reserved
	for special files, directories and devices:
.sp
		1	The core file written by "sys save" or a
			bad system call
		2	The "dd" directory directory
		3	The "system" directory
		6	The "ttyin" special file
		7	The "keyboard" (graphic-2) special file
		8	The "pptin" (paper tape reader) special
			file
		10	The "ttyout" special file
		11	The "display" (graphic-2) special file
		12	The "pptout" (paper tape punch) special
			file
.sp
	There is only one file system which is always
	mounted; it resides on the RB disk. This device
	is also used for swapping. The swap areas are at
	the high blocks on this device: blocks 6,400 to
	7,999. These blocks do not appear in the free
	list.
.sp
	Each i-node represents one file. The format of
	an i-node is as follows, where the left column
	represents the offset in words from the
	beginning of the i-node:
.sp
		0	flags (see below)
		1	first indirect block or contents block
		...
		7	seventh indirect block or contents block
		8	user ID of owner
		9	link count
		10	size in words
		11	unique value assigned at creation
.sp
	The flags are as follows:
.sp
		400000   i-node is allocated
		200000   large file
		??????   allocated bit (always on)
		000040   special file
		000020   directory
		000010   read, owner
		000004   write, owner
		000002   read, non-owner
		000001   write, non-owner
.sp
	The allocated bit (flag ??????) is believed even
	if the i-node map says the i-node is free; thus
	corruption of the map may cause i-nodes to
	become unallocatable, but will not cause active
	nodes to be reused.
.sp
	Word number n of a file is accessed as follows:
	n is divided by 64 to find its logical block
	number (say b) in the file. If the file is small
	(flag 200000 is 0), then b must be less than 7,
	and the physical block number corresponding to b
	is the bth entry in the address portion of the
	i-node.
.sp
	If the file is large, b is divided by 64 to
	yield a number which must be less than 8 (or
	the file is too large for UNIX to handle).
	The corresponding slot in the i-node address
	portion gives the physical block number of an
	indirect block. The residue mod 64 gives a
	word offset in the indirect block, and the
	word found there is the physical address of
	the block corresponding to b.
.sp
	If block b in a file exists, it is not necessary
	that all blocks less than b exist. A zero block
	number either in the address words of the i-node
	or in an indirect block indicates that the
	corresponding block has never been allocated.
	Such a missing block reads as if it contained
	all zero words.
