	" dskio depends on the DSLS_BITS after jump to subroutine:
	"    jms dskio; DSLS_BITS
	" DSLS_BITS 02000 causes a read, 03000 causes a write.
	"
	" In both cases 10 blocks worth of data is either transferred from
	" disk into dskbuf (read), or transferred from dskbuf onto the disk
	" (write). A block is the same as a segment, each comprising 64 words.
	"
	" The location on disk is controlled by the variable "side" and the
	" value in AC, representing the number of blocks from the start
	" of the side.
	"
	" dskio takes the block address passed in AC, divides it by 80
	" to get the track address, and as a remainder the segment address.
	" Both are then re-encoded as BCD, shifted to the correct bit
	" positions (explained below) and ORed together with the value of
	" the "side" variable (representing the hundreds flag in the disk
	" address). This disk address is then passed on to the disk just
	" before starting the transfer in chunks of 10 segments each.
	"
	" The disk address for RB09 disks is formatted like this:
	"
	" * Bit 0 not used
	" * Bit 1 hundreds flag for track address
	" * Bits 2-5 Tens digit for track address as BCD
	" * Bits 6-9 Units digit for track address as BCD
	" * Bits 10-13 Tens digit for segment address as BCD
	" * Bits 14-17 Units digit for segment address as BCD
	"
	" If the disk indicates an error the transfer is attempted 10 times
	" before dskio gives up and halts the program.
